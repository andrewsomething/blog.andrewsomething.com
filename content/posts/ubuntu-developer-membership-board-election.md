An election for a recently opened spot on the [DMB][] has just begun.
While all the names of those nominated are familiar to me, I still need
some more information to make a decision. All of the candidates
are eminently qualified. Unfortunately, the call for votes didn't
include any statements of intent from the candidates. Votes will be
accepted through 2011-09-06 12:00 (presumably UTC). So perhaps we'll
hear from the candidates themselves. Until then, to save others a little
bit of Googling, here are their Launchpad profiles and Ubuntu wiki
pages:

-   Charlie Smotherman (porthose) - [Launchpad][] - [Wiki][]
-   Micah Gersten (micahg) - [Launchpad][1] - [Wiki][2]
-   Stefano Rivera (tumbleweed) - [Launchpad][3] - [Wiki][4]
-   Dave Walker (Daviey) - [Launchpad][5] - [Wiki][6]
