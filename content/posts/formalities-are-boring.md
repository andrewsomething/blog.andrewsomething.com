![Old Faithful][1]

I've been following [the discussion][] around the potential switch from
Banshee back to Rhythmbox for Precise, and I really don't have all that
much to add. Though I did come across [an interesting post][] from an
upstream Tomboy developer that deserves some wider attention. He argues
that "upstreams would be more than happy to do a lot of stuff for Ubuntu
if only Ubuntu actually let them know what they wanted in some sort of
predictable fashion."

He also tells a story about Tomboy nearly being dropped last cycle due
to depending on a number of libraries that the desktop team wanted to
drop form the CD images. He goes on to suggest that formalizing the
procedure around these sorts of things would reduce a lot of confusion
and let upstreams know where they stand.

This seems entirely reasonable to me. The Banshee issue aside, it would
be great if there was a formal announcement at some set point in the
cycle where the targeted development goals for the platform are laid out
in one place. If you follow closely this information is already
announced, but it is in a trickle of different messages to the devel and
desktop lists. The  idea would be to compile this information into one
clear widely-publicized announcement. It would be early enough in the
cycle that upstreams, derivatives, and other stake holders would have
time to react. It would also make clear that any discussion before that
point is just that, discussion not  decisions. The existing [Feature
Definition Freeze][] would probably make for a nice fit.
