![Calendar][]One thing I've been missing recently has been having the
Ubuntu [release schedule][] in my calendar. [Steve Langasek][] used to
provide [one in ical format][], but it wasn't update for Natty nor
Oneiric. [The Fridge][] has a calandar containing a schedule of events
for  \#ubuntu-meeting, but that doesn't include the release schedule.
It's also a bit too high volume for me to want to keep it in my
main calendar view.

So without further adieu, I am announcing that I will be maintaining a
public Google Calendar for the Ubuntu release schedule.
