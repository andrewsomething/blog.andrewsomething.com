[![AskUbuntu][2]][1]

[AskUbuntu][1] is continuing to grow. According to the
Stack Exchange [site directory][], we have:

-   17k Questions
-   31k Answers
-   19k User
-   21k Visits/Day
-   81% of questions have accepted answers

While 81% puts us into the same league as Stack Overflow and Super User,
we still have hundreds of questions without any answer at all. In fact,
about 10% of all are questions are [unanswered][]. Here's just a handful
of them:


-   [How to restrict / limit the number of RDP sessions?][]
-   [How do I configure a fingerprint scanner?][]
-   [How to set up a Serial-to-Ethernet Converter With a Virtual Serial Port?][]
-   [How do I share files with a Mac?][]
-   [Where are debug symbols for backported packages?][]
-   [Anyone using KVM with Spice protocol on Ubuntu?][]
-   [Check if pendrive is persistent?][]


Killing some free time on the internets? How about you stop looking at
lolcatz and answer a few questions that slipped through the cracks? How
about starting with mine:


[Why use sbuild over pbuilder?][]
