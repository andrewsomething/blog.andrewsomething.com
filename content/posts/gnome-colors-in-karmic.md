![GNOME-Colors][]

With hundreds of thousands of downloads on GNOME-Look, [GNOME-Colors][1]
(and its friends [Shiki-Colors][] and [Arc-Colors][]) is with out a
doubt one of the most popular themes around for the GNOME desktop. It's
no surprise withÂ  six different color themes and the ability to match
you icon theme, GTK+ theme, GDM theme, and wallpaper. Victor (aka
perfectska04) has put together a wonderful set, and it's about time that
they are in the Ubuntu archives.

I'm pleased to announce that they are now all just a simple apt-get
install away in Karmic.

The meta-packages **gnome-colors, arc-colors, and shiki-colors** will
pull in all six color variations. For those with low bandwidth or
expensive connections, you can also just install single variations:
gnome-{brave, dust, human, noble, wine, or wise}-icon-theme,
shiki-{brave, dust, human, noble, wine, or wise}-theme, and arc-{brave,
dust, human, noble, wine, or wise}. There's also a Xfwm/Xfce4 theme:
shiki-colors-xfwm-theme.

For those still running Hardy, Intrepid, or Jaunty, we're also running a
[GNOME-Colors PPA][] where you will always be able to grab the latest
versions.

So much thanks to Victor for the themes and being so open to making
changes upstream that made things easier for us to package and Benjamin
Drung for all his work to make this happen.
