I am sure you've all seen this already, but I just wanted
to add my congratulations every one involved in the [open][]
[sourcing][] of [Launchpad][]!

After the friendly and inclusive nature of the Ubuntu community,
Launchpad and Bazzar really are responsible for deepening my involvement
in development. I find LP much more welcoming and user-friendly than
Debian's BTS (though I really love and depend on [PTS][]), Bugzilla, or
Trac. It's cross-project intregration is really a killer feature. Bazzar
both introduced me to DVCS and convinced me of its supriority to
Subversion. I also just find it so much more user-friendly than other
solutions such as GIT (although admittedly I have no experience with
Mercurial).

I'm glad that the platform that has encouraged me to contribute to open
source has finally become open source itself (soyuz included!).
