*Ubuntu NGO will be having its first meeting this Friday, [26th June
2009, 15:00 UTC][] in [#ubuntu-ngo on irc.freenode.net][]*


A little over a month ago, Daniel Holbach asked [who was using Ubuntu in
their NGO?][] In the time that's passed, a group of Ubunteros has
coalesced around the idea of making Ubuntu a great platform for NGOs,
non-profits, and charities. Whether they're using Ubuntu in their back
office, their web server, or giving out refurbished computers loaded
with Ubuntu, we want to focus on the specific needs they face and how
Ubuntu can help meet them.

I'm especially excited about this new initiative as over my life I've
been involved with a number of non-profit and advocacy organizations. I
see this project as a way to tie together two things I'm involved with
that seem separate but come from similar motivations, making the world a
better place and give back to community. It's a natural fit for the
Ubuntu community as well. The same things that motivate so many of us to
contribute to Ubuntu motivate others (and some of us) to work for and
volunteer at NGOs.

There are a lot of possibilities with this, and it's just starting to
take shape now. It's a great time to join in and help shape the group
and our goals. Come to the meeting. [Join the team.][] Check out the
[wiki page][] and see some of the [things we've already started working
on][].

Some of the things we're interested in are:

-   Finding out about NGOs that are using Ubuntu right now and sharing
    their stories.
-   Studying different use cases.
-   Documenting of best practices.
-   Looking at work that some LoCo teams have already done and
    encouraging connection between NGOs and LoCos.
-   Investigating ways to deal with regions without Internet access.
-   Packaging a CRM solution for non-profits.

That last point is something that I've already begun working on. We've
started packaging [CiviCRM][], an open-source constituent relationship
management solution designed specifically to meet the needs of advocacy,
non-profit and non-governmental groups. Our packaging branch is host on
Launchpad: [lp:~ubuntu-ngo/civicrm/ubuntu][] If you're interested in
pitching in, there's a TODO file in /debian and a watch file to pull the
upstream source. I'd be particularly grateful if someone with experience
packaging with dbconfig-common took a look.

This is a great opportunity to get in a the beginning of an important
project! Our first meeting is this Friday, [26th June 2009, 15:00 UTC][]
in [#ubuntu-ngo on irc.freenode.net][]

Got any ideas? Let me know in the comments!
