Alright, I've been a Ubuntu Member since last October, and I haven't set
up a blog to be syndicated on Planet Ubuntu yet. That changes now. There
hasn't been an UbuntuOne post in almost two days. I just couldn't let
that happen. Let me tell you what I think!

Alright, I'm just kidding. You don't have any reason to care what I
think about anything since chances are you have no idea who I am. So,
please allow me to introduce myself...

My name is Andrew, and I'm an [Ubuntu Universe Contributor][] (aka
Ubuntu Contributing Developer). I've been an Ubuntu user since Feisty
and an active contributor since the Hardy cycle.Â  I also maintain a [few
packages][] directly in Debian. You can find out more about my specific
contributions on my [wiki page][] or on my[Launchpad profile][]. I'll
also be up in front of the MOTU-Council on May 28th, as I've finally
[applied to become a MOTU][]!

So why start a blog? Well, I'm not sure how much I'll end up posting
here, but I'd like to think that some of the things I've gone through in
my journey into the world of Ubuntu development will be helpful to
others thinking about diving in...
