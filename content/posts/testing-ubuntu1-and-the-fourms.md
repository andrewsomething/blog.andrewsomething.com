Ubuntu+1 has an active user based which needs to be better utilized.
Over at the Ubuntu Forums, there is a <span class="normal">[Karmic Koala
Testing and Discussion][] sub-forum. While it's mostly users helping
each other through the bumpy adventure of running the development
release (along with some people engaged in seemingly never ending
complaining about the default theme), it's a great</span> opportunity
for engaging users in the testing and development process. Some people
are there simply due to a desire to be running bleeding edge packages,
but most truly care about making Ubuntu better.

One attempt to get people involved is the reoccurring sticky thread at
the top of the forum:**[Contributing to Karmic Koala.][]**It appears in
each development release's Testing forum. The guide originally was
produced by 23meg in the Gutsy cycle, and I refreshed it for the
Intrepid one. Nullack has gotten it together for the last two cycles,
and a number of others have contributed. The thread attempts to
familiarize users with the [Ubuntu Development process][], and points
out ways for people to contribute, from [filing bugs][] and [testing ISO
images][] to [contributing documentation][] and [fixing bugs][].

Yet, I think there is more that can be done from the developer side in
order to engage these intrepid users (and I don't mean 8.10). Most
discussions and calls for testing new features in Ubuntu+1 happen on
[ubuntu-devel][], and I'm not proposing moving it to the forums. Yet,
the habits of most developers are quite different than those of most
users. There's a reason that more people seek support on forums than on
mailing lists. Over on the forums, we have an audience of users running
Ubuntu+1 who love running the most recent packages and love to let you
know what they think about them. It's the perfect audience for calls for
testing new features, ect. I've seen a few devs pop up there with such
requests, but there's a lot of missed opportunities.

During the Jaunty cycle, I was able to get helpful feed back on a number
of my uploads by asking users in the forum to test a package in my PPA
before submitting it for the official archive. Additionally, just by
lurking around, I caught a few packages that almost sneaked into the
release broken due to the python transition.

While I don't expect developers to hold the user's hand and provide
support for running the development release, simple things like
cross-posting call for testing to the forums could go a long way to
better taking advantage of an under used resourse.

A big thank you to all those brave enough to run the development branch!

P.S. Always remember, the is no guarantee that Ubuntu+1 will not eat you
babies, destroy all your data, or make your computer explode.
