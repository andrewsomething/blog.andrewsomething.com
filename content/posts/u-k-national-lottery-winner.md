Well, not really....

For some reason, my spam folder doesn't contain the usual Viagra, porn,
and Nigerian prince emails.  The most frequent spam I receive generally
is letting me know that I just won £1,000,000 in the U.K. National
Lottery. As I've only been in the U.K. once, and I certainly never
played the lottery while there, I assume they are a [scam][].
([Although, there might actually be some lottery official out there who
doesn't understand why I don't want to collect my money.][1])

Well, the other day I opened an email from a British company that began:
"Congratulations!" This time I'm pretty sure it wasn't a scam. The good
folks at Canonical accepted my sponsorship request for[UDS Dallas][]! As
this will be my first UDS, I'm incredibly excited. I just booked my
tickets, and can't wait to finally meet you all in meatspace.

See you in Dallas!
