[![Breathe Icon Theme][2]][1]

The Ubuntu Artwork community just made the first official beta release
of theÂ  Breathe Icon Theme. It's a refresh of the Human icon theme using
Oxygen as a base. The idea is to create as modern a set as Oxygen but
with that distinctly Human feel.

You can grab the 0.43 release on the [GNOME-Look page][1] or on the
[Ubuntu wiki][]. You can also check out the source on [Launchpad][].

It's being developed by community members over on the [Artwork Team
list-serve][]. Drop by, join in and share your ideas.
