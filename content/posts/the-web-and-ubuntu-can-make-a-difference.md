The week of September 14-21, 2009 is [Mozilla Service Week][], brought
to you by the good folks behind Firefox and Thunderbird. They've
partnered with [Idealist.org][], a non-profit jobs listing site, to link
service-minded techies with non-profit organizations in need to their
help.

> We're looking for people who want to share, give, engage, create, and
> collaborate by offering their time and talent to local organizations
> and people who need their help.
>
> Mozilla believes everyone should know how to use the Internet, have
> easy access to it, and have a good experience when they're online. By
> utilizing our community's talents for writing, designing, programming,
> developing, and all-around technical know-how, we believe we can make
> the Web a better place for everyone.
