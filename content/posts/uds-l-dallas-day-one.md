Well, I finally made it to a Ubuntu Developer Summit. It's been great to
put some faces on the names I interact with on mailing-lists and read in
changelogs.

I don't really have much to pontificate on so this will be quick, but
there are a couple things to share.

My roommate ending up being Daniel Fore, designer of the
elementary icon set that the Humanity icons are based on. So I was able
to help get them up on a [PPA.][2]

You can grab packages based on the latests Bazaar trunk for Karmic.

I mostly focused on attending sessions on bug management and distributed
development today. I saved copies of the gobby notes for each session I
attended:Â  <http://people.ubuntu.com/~andrewsomething/uds-l/notes/>

The plenary session demoing [Quickly][] made me excited to dive back
into [python][]. The videos aren't up yet, but there are previous
[screen-casts][] showing it off.
