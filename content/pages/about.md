Slug: about

While I have a great many opinions on a wide variety of things, this blog
is (mostly) dedicated to my contributions to Free and Open Source Software.

I'm an Ubuntu and Debian Developer. Check out my [Launchpad profile][], 
[Ubuntu Wiki page][], my [Debian QA page][], and my [GitHub account][] for more
details on my specific contributions.

On the non-FOSS front, I have a MS in Urban Affairs and on occasion considered
referring to myself as an urbanist. I thought better of it, realizing how pretentious
that sounds.
