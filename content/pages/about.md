I'm an Ubuntu and DebianÂ Developer.

Check out my [Launchpad profile][] and [Ubuntu Wiki page][] for more
details on my specific contributions.

This is a place for me to share my thoughts on Ubuntu development and
god knows what else.

On the non-Ubuntu front, I'm a graduate student of Urban Affairs in New
York City.
