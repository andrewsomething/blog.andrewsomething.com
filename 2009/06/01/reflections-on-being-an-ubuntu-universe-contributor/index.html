            <p>Last week I made the big leap from &#8220;contributor&#8221; to &#8220;developer.&#8221; At the
most recent <span class="caps">MOTU</span>-Council meeting, my application to become a Master of
the Universe was&nbsp;approved!</p>
<p>Now, I want to take a minute and think about the Ubuntu Universe
Contributor (aka Ubuntu Contributing Developers) program, how we can
better utilize it, and ultimately encourage more people to get involved
in Ubuntu development. But first of all, what is the <span class="caps">UUC</span> program&nbsp;anyway?</p>
<p>On the<a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopers">wiki page</a>, Ubuntu Contributing Developers and their roles are
described&nbsp;as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are members of the universe-contributors team in&nbsp;Launchpad</li>
<li>Are collectively responsible for the maintenance of most of the
    packages in Ubuntu (the universe and multiverse&nbsp;components)</li>
<li>Merge new versions from Debian, work on bugfixes and new&nbsp;packages</li>
<li>Continue with sponsored&nbsp;uploads</li>
<li>Participate in technical discussions with other Ubuntu developers,
    providing ideas and&nbsp;feedback</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s pretty vague. A lot of people who aren&#8217;t UUCs do merges, work on
bug fixes, and get uploads sponsored. The qualifications for joining are
even more so. You have to meet the requirements to be an <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership">Ubuntu
Member</a> and submit an application to the the <span class="caps">MOTU</span>-Council.</p>
<p>We need to be more clear on both the goals of the team and what it takes
to join. But this becomes a bit of a sticky issue. We shouldn&#8217;t be
placing hard metrics on the requirements for joining. Joining should be
about the quality not quantity of uploads and connecting contributors to
the development community not quizzing them on technical aspects.
Becoming an <span class="caps">UUC</span> doesn&#8217;t give you upload rights, but it does make you an
Ubuntu Member. So while it is a development centered path to Ubuntu
Membership, its really a community designation not a technical&nbsp;one.</p>
<p>So how about who is an <span class="caps">UUC</span>? Looking at the <span class="caps">UUC</span><a href="https://edge.launchpad.net/~universe-contributors/+members">members list</a>, you see
that there are 16 individuals on the team. Including Chow Loong Jin
(<a href="https://edge.launchpad.net/~hyperair">hyperair</a>), who just joined, congrats! Of those, nine of us have
gone on to make <span class="caps">MOTU</span>. So there are only seven proper Ubuntu Universe
Contributors. So, it seems that becoming a <span class="caps">UUC</span> is a good step to
becoming a <span class="caps">MOTU</span>, but still not all that many people are using the
program. In fact, more people have become MOTUs this year so far than
have become&nbsp;UUCs.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://thc.emgent.org/utu/utu_jaunty.php">Ubuntu Top Uploaders list</a>, 395 people uploaded at least
one package in Jaunty (although it&#8217;s not a completely accurate count as
some people have more than one listing due to using more than one email
address). Of those, only about 100 people uploaded more than 10
packages. The top 25 all have over a hundred uploads. The level of
involement is amazing, but it is also extremely top heavy. We need to
shift that curve&nbsp;down.</p>
<p>For me, the main goals of the <span class="caps">UUC</span> program should be to draw reoccurring
contributors further into the community and acknowledging them for the
work they have already done. It&#8217;s about both retaining contributors and
increasing their involvement. The more connections someone has with a
project the more likely they will continue to contribute and increase
their level of commitment. Someone who gets a few patches sponsored into
Ubuntu but doesen&#8217;t get involved in the community may well switch
distributions when they have an issue and take their contributions with
them. Someone who becomes engaed in the community will stick around and
help solve the&nbsp;issue.</p>
<p>We also need to be making it easier for contributors to navigate the
sometime bureaucratic processes involved with getting patches sponsored
into Ubuntu. <a href="http://drowninginbugs.blogspot.com/2009/06/action-items-from-uds-barcelona.html">Dan Chen has already talked</a>about some of the plans
coming out of <span class="caps">UDS</span> Barcelona, including a new Launchpad group to take on
this issue,&nbsp;ubuntu-reviewers.</p>
<p>As every one who went to <span class="caps">UDS</span> is now home, I expect we&#8217;ll hear alot more
about the discussions that went on there. I&#8217;m looking forward to it, and
hope to find ways that I can help make the plans made there a&nbsp;reality.</p>
<p>So, if you&#8217;ve read this far, what are you&#8217;re thoughts? Have you
contributed to Ubuntu? What was the most annoying part? Have you
considered joining the Ubuntu Universe Contributor team? What&#8217;s stopped&nbsp;you?</p>
